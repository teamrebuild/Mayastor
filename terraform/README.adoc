== Quick start

. Ensure you have libvirtd or lxd running and configured **correctly** (do not use btrfs or ZFS as a storage pool for LXD).
. Edit `variables.tf` in particular make sure the public key and the path to private key is correct. Do not set `num_nodes` to less than two.
. Edit `main.tf` if you want to use LXD instead of libvirtd.
. If on NixOS, enter the nix-shell before running the terraform commands.
. Run `terraform init`.
. Run `terraform plan`.
. Run `terraform apply`.

Once the cluster VMs/containers are running, you can use kubectl to manage
your cluster from the host. You just need to copy '/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf`
from ksnode-1 to `~/.kube/config` on your host.

And you are all set to deploy mayastor.

== Problem statement

When we want to deploy our "k8s storage" system, we want to create and destroy
k8s clusters very quickly and without any pain regardless of where you deploy
it.

So this means we want to deploy it to:

1. KVM (locally)
2. LXD (locally)
3. AWS
4. GCE
5. Azure
6. Rancher
7. ...

We, however, do not "just" want to deploy k8s, but also want to be able to
interact with the hosts themsleves. For example; verify that we indeed have a
new nvmf target or what have you.

So we need a form of infra management but also - configuration management.
These scripts are intended to do just that.

Currently the scripts only support KVM and LXD deployments.

== Terraform

Terraform is used to construct the actual cluster and install Kubernetes. By
default only the libvirtd and lxd providers are available.

However, the code has been structured such that we can change the provider
module in `main.tf` to any other provider and get the same k8s cluster.

We can, for example, add `mod/vbox` which will then deploy 3 virtual vbox nodes.
The k8s deployment code is decoupled from the actual VMs. The VMs are assumed to
be *Ubuntu* based and makes use of *cloud-init*

After the deployment of the VMs, the `k8s` module runs. This module will invoke
using the output from the previous provider, provisioners to install k8s on the
master node.

=== Setting up libvirt

. Follow OS-specific steps to install libvirt
. Download ubuntu image in qcow2 format: `wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/bionic/current/bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64.img`
. Set `qcow2_image` TF variable to a location of the downloaded image

TF commands don't need to be run with sudo, though internally TF uses
`qemu:///system` context so when checking libvirt resources by virsh
use either `--connect qemu:///system` parameter or
`export LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI=qemu:///system`.

Once the cluster is set up using TF, at the end will be printed ansible
inventory file that makes guests management so much easier. Save the output
to a file (i.e. ansible-hosts), install ansible on your host and you can
run any command using ad-hoc ansible module on any or all hosts.

For example to create kube config file for use with kubectl, run following
command and copy paste the output to `~/.kube/config`:

[source,bash]
----
ansible -i ansible-hosts -a 'sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf' master
----

=== Setting up libvirt on Nixos

To use the libvirt provider, you must enable libvirtd

[source]
----
boot.extraModprobeConfig = "options kvm_intel nested=1"; // <1>
virtualisation.libvirtd.enable = true;

users.users.gila = {
    isNormalUser = true;
    extraGroups = [ "wheel" "libvirtd" "vboxusers" ]; // <2>
};
----
<1> depends on CPU vendor (intel vs amd)
<2> make sure you pick the right user name

=== Setting up LXD

Using LXD is faster and requires fewer resources. Also, you can do many things
with lxd that you typically can't do quickly or easily with VMs.

Beware that for an unknown reason filesystem probe done by csi agent fails
(it is unable to unmount xfs filesystem that it mounted before). Hence without
removing the probe code from the agent and publishing a patched docker image
it is not really possible to test mayastor on LXD cluster! As an alternative
use VMs.

The following kernel modules must be loaded:
```
ip_tables
ip6_tables
nf_nat
overlay
netlink_diag
br_netfilter
```

And if you decide to use LVM storage backend then also:
```
dm-snapshot
dm-mirror
dm_thin_pool
```

See linux distribution specific section on how to install LXD on the
distro of your choice.

After that run `lxd init` and configure it to suit k8s cluster and your
needs. In particular:

. **do not use btrfs or ZFS** as a storage pool. Docker's AUFS storage driver does not work with them out of the box.
. **use eth0** for network interface name in the containers. dhcp config script depends on it.

TODO: add copy-paste of screen with user inputs for lxd init.

It is *important* to test that LXD works before you move to terraform
apply step. Create a container and test that it can reach the internet.

[source,bash]
----
lxc launch ubuntu:18.04 first
lxc exec first -- /bin/bash -c 'curl http://google.com/'
----

Once the cluster is set up, copy kube config file from lxd guest
to your host:

[source,bash]
----
lxc exec ksnode-1 -- cat /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf > ~/.kube/config
----

Later when testing mayastor you will need `/dev/nbd` device(s) in /dev of
the lxc containers. To propagate nbd0 device from the host to ksnode-1
container run:

[source,bash]
----
lxc config device add ksnode-1 nbd0 unix-block path=/dev/nbd0
----

==== LXD on Nixos

Make sure that your system is using *unstable channel* for nixpkgs (at least
LXD v4 is required).

LXD config in `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

[source,nix]
----
  virtualisation.lxd.enable = true;
  virtualisation.lxd.zfsSupport = false;
  users.extraGroups.lxd.members = [ "your-user" ];
  users.extraGroups.lxc.members = [ "your-user" ];

  # Following line needed only if you choose LVM backend for LXC
  # Following line is a workaround for the issue of lvm tools not being
  # in the PATH of LXD (https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/31117)
  systemd.services.lxd.path = with pkgs; [ lvm2 thin-provisioning-tools e2fsprogs ];

  # Needed for kube-proxy pod that crashes if the hashsize is not big enough.
  # It can't be modified from inside the container even if sys is mounted rw.
  boot.extraModprobeConfig = ''
    options nf_conntrack hashsize=393216
  '';
----

==== LXD on other linux distros

There is no requirement to use LXD v4 as on the NixOS. LXD v3 works just fine.

When it comes to installing terraform with LXD provider, manually install the
lxd provider from https://github.com/sl1pm4t/terraform-provider-lxd by
downloading a release, extracting it to `~/.terraform.d/plugins` then renaming
the binary, dropping the version.

The way the terraform plugin works is not -- default. All plugins are evaluated
in the terraform-providers expression, which reads other files from disks. So a
simple override -- as far as I know,  won't work in this case more so, because
the expression removes attributes and whatnot.

As such a workaround is to install the plugin via nix-env and then run:

```
export NIX_TERRAFORM_PLUGIN_DIR=/home/gila/.nix-profile/bin
```

=== Main configuration file

The main configuration file is `variables.tf` where all fields **must** be set.
The `image_path` variable assumes a pre-downloaded image, but you can also set
it to fetch from HTTP. For example:

[source,bash]
----
cd /path/to/my/images
wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/xenial/current/xenial-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img
----

== Private docker repo

On NixOS just add following lines to your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix and
run `nixos-rebuild switch`.

[source,nix]
----
  services.dockerRegistry = {
    enable = true;
    listenAddress = "0.0.0.0";
    enableDelete = true;
    # port = 5000;
  };
----

On other distros you should edit the docker daemon config file to suit your
needs. An example configuration could be something like the following:

[source,bash]
----

cd /path/to/store
mkdir data

cat << EOF > docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

services:
  registry:
    image: registry:2
    ports:
    - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      REGISTRY_STORAGE_FILESYSTEM_ROOTDIRECTORY: /data
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
EOF

docker-compose up
----

Subsequently, you can push mayastor images there using docker or skopeo.
Examples below are for moac image. Similarly you should push mayastor and
mayastor-csi images. Replace "hostname" by the name of your registry host.

[source,bash]
----
nix-build '<nixpkgs>' -A node-moacImage
docker load <result
docker tag mayadata/moac hostname:5000/moac:latest
docker push hostname:5000/moac:latest
----

[source,bash]
----
nix-build '<nixpkgs>' -A node-moacImage
skopeo copy --dest-tls-verify=false docker-archive:result docker://hostname:5000/mayadata/moac:latest
----

Nodes in the k8s cluster will refuse to pull images from such registry
because it is insecure (not using tls). To work around this problem
modify `mod/k8s/repo.sh` adding insecure-registry to daemon.json and
then provision your cluster.

Now edit mayastor deployment yamls and change all mayastor & moac image
names to point to your private docker registry. For moac image that would be
`image: mayadata/moac:latest` -> `image: hostname:5000/mayadata/moac:latest`.
