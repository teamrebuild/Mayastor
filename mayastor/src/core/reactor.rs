//! The first thing that needs to happen is to initialize DPDK, this among
//! others provides us with lockless queues which we use to send messages
//! between the cores.  Typically, these messages contain simple function
//! pointers and argument pointers.
//!
//! Per core data structure, there are so-called threads. These threads
//! represent, not to be confused with OS threads are created dynamically
//! depending on the subsystem(s). For example, an NVMF subsystem might create a
//! new thread instance on a given core. This separates different types of work
//! and allows us to divide work between cores evenly.
//!
//! To summarize, a reactor instance to CPU core is a one-to-one relation. A
//! reactor, in turn, may have one or more thread objects. The thread objects
//! MAY hold messages for a specific subsystem. During init, per reactor, we
//! create one thread which is always thread 0.
//!
//! During the poll loop, we traverse all threads and poll each queue of that
//! thread. The functions executed are all executed within the context of that
//! thread. This in effect means that we set a TLS pointer to the thread that we
//! are polling. This context is verified during run time, such that we can
//! ensure that, for example,  a bdev (say) that is open, is closed within the
//! same context as it was opened with.
//!
//! The queue of each thread is unique, but the messages in the queue are all
//! preallocated from a global pool. This prevents allocations at runtime.
//!
//! Alongside that, each reactor (currently) has two additional queues. One
//! queue is for receiving and sending messages between cores. The other queue
//! is used for holding on to the messages while it is being processed. Once
//! processed (or completed) it is dropped from the queue. Unlike the native
//! SPDK messages, these futures -- are allocated before they execute.
